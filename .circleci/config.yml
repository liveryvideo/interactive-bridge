# Notes:
#
# Lint and test could be executed in parallel, but that would only make things slower.
# Other then that everything is sequentially dependent.
#
# By re-using a test command instead of requiring a test job before release
# we don't need to persist to a workspace which saves time.
#
# Note: semantic-release depends on the GitHub liveryvideo "web" context for GH_TOKEN and NPM_TOKEN
# environment variables for repo write and package publish access.
#
# Note that this uses the cimg/node -browsers docker image variant and circleci/browser-tools to install
# Chrome which is used by web-test-runner to run our unit tests.
